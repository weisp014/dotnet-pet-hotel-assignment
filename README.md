# Pet Hotel 

Our team - Ryan, Siv, Lee, Steven, and Lily - practiced implementing a React front end with a C# backend. The goal was to pass all unit tests. 

We learned the essentials of object oriented proramming, focusing on strict typing, classes, objects, methods, and routing. 

Ultimately, the program allows the user to track pet owners and their pets. The user can check pets in and out to track which pets are staying at the hotel. 

We practiced migrations, setting up a .NET SDK dev environment, and satisfying front end requests when the requirements differ from the backend requirements. 

Thank you for viewing our process and allowing us to demonstrate our understanding! 

The front end we employed can be found at: [Pet Hotel Front End](https://github.com/weisp014/pethotel-dotnet-frontend)
